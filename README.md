# Retail Store Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview
Inventory management is a critical part of retail business operations. Poor inventory planning can lead to overstocking, increased storage costs, or stock-outs that reduce customer satisfaction. With the growth of data-driven decision-making, analyzing inventory data has become essential for improving efficiency and profitability.

This project presents an end-to-end retail store inventory analysis using real-world data. The dataset is analyzed using Python to understand sales trends, inventory levels, demand patterns, and the impact of external factors such as promotions and weather conditions. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps uncover hidden insights and relationships within the data.

In addition, machine learning techniques are applied to support demand analysis and inventory decision-making. The insights obtained from data analysis are visualized using Power BI dashboards, making the results easy to understand for business users. This project demonstrates how data science can be effectively used in retail inventory management.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how retail inventory data can be transformed into meaningful insights using data analysis and machine learning techniques. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model development, important patterns related to sales performance and inventory levels were identified.

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive visualization of inventory trends, product performance, and demand behavior, enabling better decision-making. The results of this analysis can help retailers optimize stock levels, reduce losses due to overstocking or shortages, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Overall, this project highlights the importance of combining Python-based analytics with business intelligence tools to create a complete and practical retail inventory analysis solution.
